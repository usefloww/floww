I am building a cli for deploying applications and want the best developer experience possible. Can you research the best loggers or logging frameworks or ui frameworks out there that would allow me to really make the developer experience a top priority. Examples: floww deploy Should show the progress of deploying which may contain a docker build etc, if the build is successful, it is often not useful to show the full build output to the developer so I want to hide it and just show a checkbox with build done or something like that If not succesfull I would like to clearly show the full log with a warning that this step failed floww dev Incoming requests should be shown clearly and maybe I even want the ability to click retry on incoming requests to allow the user to quickly retry certain incoming requests
