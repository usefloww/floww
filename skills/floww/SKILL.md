# Floww SDK

Floww is a code-first workflow automation platform. You write automations in TypeScript using provider classes, then deploy them with the CLI.

## Quick Start

### New project

```bash
npx floww init
```

This scaffolds: `floww.yaml`, `main.ts`, `package.json` (and optionally `Dockerfile` for custom builds).

### Edit an existing workflow

To modify a workflow that's already deployed, use the pull-edit-deploy loop:

```bash
# 1. Pull the deployed source code into an empty directory
mkdir my-workflow && cd my-workflow
npx floww pull <workflow-id-or-name>

# 2. Read and edit the files (the entrypoint and other source files are now local)
# 3. Redeploy
npx floww deploy
```

`floww pull` downloads all source files from the active deployment and creates a `floww.yaml` with the correct `workflowId`, `entrypoint`, and provider mappings. After editing, `floww deploy` pushes the changes back.

**Directory rules for `floww pull`:**
- **Empty directory + workflow arg**: Pulls files and creates `floww.yaml` (clone use case)
- **Directory with `floww.yaml` + no arg**: Pulls from the configured workflow (update use case)
- **Directory with `floww.yaml` + workflow arg**: Error (use `floww pull` without arguments)
- **Non-empty directory without `floww.yaml`**: Error (use an empty directory)

**JSON output** (for programmatic/agent use):
```bash
npx floww pull <workflow-id-or-name> --json
```

Returns `{ workflowId, workflowName, deploymentId, entrypoint, files, directory }`.

### Development (local with hot-reload)

```bash
npx floww dev
```

Runs locally, watches files, provides webhook URLs for testing. If providers aren't configured yet, the CLI prompts interactively.

### Deploy to production

```bash
npx floww deploy
```

If no Dockerfile is present, uses a pre-built default runtime (no Docker needed). If a Dockerfile exists, builds a custom image.

## Core Pattern

Every automation follows this pattern:

1. Import and instantiate providers
2. Register triggers with handlers
3. Call actions inside handlers

```typescript
import { Builtin, GitHub, Slack } from "floww";

const builtin = new Builtin();
const github = new GitHub();
const slack = new Slack();

github.triggers.onPush({
  owner: "my-org",
  repository: "my-repo",
  handler: async (ctx, event) => {
    await slack.actions.sendMessage({
      channel: "#deployments",
      text: `New push to ${event.body.repository.name}`,
    });
  },
});
```

Key rules:
- Triggers register themselves when instantiated -- no default export needed
- Handler signature is always `(ctx, event) => { ... }`
- For webhook/provider triggers, event data is in `event.body`
- For cron triggers, use `event.scheduledTime`
- Actions are async: always `await provider.actions.actionName({ ... })`

## Project Structure

### `floww.yaml`

```yaml
name: my-workflow
version: 1.0.0
entrypoint: main.ts
workflowId: <auto-generated-uuid>
# Optional - only needed for custom Docker builds:
# build:
#   type: docker
#   context: .
#   dockerfile: ./Dockerfile
```

- `entrypoint`: The TypeScript file containing your triggers (default: `main.ts`)
- `workflowId`: Auto-assigned during `floww init` or `floww pull`, links to the workflow in the dashboard
- `build`: Optional. Only needed if you have a custom Dockerfile. Omit to use the default runtime.
- `providers`: Auto-populated provider mappings (maps code aliases to provider IDs)

### `main.ts`

Your automation code. All trigger registrations happen at the top level (not inside functions).

### `package.json`

Must include `"floww"` as a dependency. The `"type": "module"` field is required.

```json
{
  "type": "module",
  "dependencies": {
    "floww": "*"
  }
}
```

## Available Providers

The following providers are available in the Floww SDK (all imported from `"floww"`):

**Event Sources & Triggers:**
- `Builtin` - Cron schedules, webhooks, manual triggers
- `GitHub` - Repository events (push, pull requests, issues, releases, etc.)
- `Slack` - Message and reaction events
- `Discord` - Message, reaction, and member events
- `Gitlab` - Merge request events
- `Jira` - Issue and comment events
- `GoogleCalendar` - Calendar events

**Actions & Integrations:**
- `GitHub` - Issue, PR, file, branch, release, workflow operations
- `Slack` - Messages, channels, users, reactions, files
- `Discord` - Messages, channels, roles, members
- `Jira` - Issue management, comments, transitions
- `Todoist` - Task operations (create, update, complete, move)
- `KVStore` - Persistent key-value storage
- `Secret` - Typed secret access via Zod schema

**AI Models:**
- `AI` - Unified AI provider. Access models via `ai.models.*` (gpt4o, claude35Sonnet, gemini15Pro, etc.). The specific AI service (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) is configured in the dashboard.

AI utilities (`generateText`, `streamText`, `generateObject`, `streamObject`) are imported from `"floww/ai"`.

### Multiple credentials

Pass a credential name to use a specific configured credential:

```typescript
const github = new GitHub("my-work-account");
const slack = new Slack("team-workspace");
```

## Writing Automations

### Step 1: Identify what to automate

Determine which providers you need based on the trigger source and the actions to perform.

### Step 2: Write the code

Create `main.ts` with provider imports, instantiation, and trigger registration. Every trigger needs a `handler` function.

### Step 3: Test locally

Run `npx floww dev`. The CLI will:
- Watch your entrypoint for changes and hot-reload
- Provide webhook URLs for testing webhook triggers
- Prompt for any missing provider configurations
- Support debugging with `--debug` flag (attaches Node.js inspector on port 9229)

### Step 4: Deploy

Run `npx floww deploy`. The CLI will:
- Execute your code to discover triggers and providers
- Validate all providers are configured
- If no Dockerfile: use the default runtime (no Docker build needed)
- If Dockerfile present: build and push a custom Docker image
- Create the runtime and register triggers

## Editing Existing Workflows

To modify a workflow that's already deployed, follow the pull-edit-deploy loop:

### Step 1: Pull the deployed code

```bash
# Into an empty directory:
mkdir my-workflow && cd my-workflow
npx floww pull <workflow-id-or-name>

# Or with --json for machine-readable output:
npx floww pull <workflow-id-or-name> --json
```

This downloads all source files from the active deployment and creates `floww.yaml` with the correct configuration.

### Step 2: Read and understand the code

Read the entrypoint file (usually `main.ts`) and any other source files to understand the current workflow logic.

### Step 3: Edit the code

Make your changes to the source files. The same rules apply as writing new automations — triggers at top level, handlers with `(ctx, event)` signature, etc.

### Step 4: Redeploy

```bash
npx floww deploy
```

The `floww.yaml` already has the correct `workflowId`, so the deploy targets the same workflow. The updated code replaces the previous deployment.

### Pulling into an existing project

If you already have a `floww.yaml` (e.g., from a previous pull), just run:

```bash
npx floww pull
```

This pulls the latest deployed code for the workflow configured in `floww.yaml`, overwriting local files with the deployed versions.

## AI Integration

Use AI models from OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google via the Vercel AI SDK pattern:

```typescript
import { AI } from "floww";
import { generateText, stepCountIs } from "floww/ai";
import { z } from "zod";

const ai = new AI();

const result = await generateText({
  model: ai.models.gpt4o,
  system: "You are a helpful assistant.",
  prompt: "Summarize this data...",
  tools: {
    myTool: {
      description: "Tool description",
      inputSchema: z.object({ query: z.string() }),
      execute: async ({ query }) => { /* ... */ },
    },
  },
  stopWhen: stepCountIs(5),
});
```

Available models (depends on configured AI provider):
- OpenAI: `gpt4o`, `gpt4oMini`, `gpt4Turbo`, `o1`, `o1Mini`
- Anthropic: `claude35Sonnet`, `claude35SonnetLatest`, `claude3Opus`, `claude35Haiku`
- Google: `gemini2Flash`, `gemini15Pro`, `gemini15Flash`

## Key-Value Store

Persist data across workflow executions:

```typescript
import { KVStore } from "floww";

const kv = new KVStore();

// Direct access
await kv.set("my-table", "key", { some: "data" });
const val = await kv.get("my-table", "key");
await kv.delete("my-table", "key");

// Table handle
const table = kv.getTable<MyType>("my-table");
await table.set("key", value);
const item = await table.get("key");
```

## Typed Secrets

Access secrets with Zod schema validation:

```typescript
import { Secret } from "floww";
import { z } from "zod";

const mySecret = new Secret("my-api-key", z.object({
  apiKey: z.string(),
  baseUrl: z.string().optional(),
}));

// In a handler:
const { apiKey } = mySecret.value();
```

## CLI Reference

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `floww init` | Scaffold a new project or link an existing directory |
| `floww pull [workflow]` | Pull deployed source code for an existing workflow |
| `floww dev` | Run locally with hot-reload |
| `floww deploy` | Deploy to production (uses default runtime or custom Docker) |
| `floww login` | Authenticate with Floww |
| `floww logout` | Log out |
| `floww whoami` | Show current user |
| `floww list workflows` | List workflows |
| `floww list namespaces` | List namespaces |
| `floww list deployments` | List deployments |
| `floww list providers` | List configured providers |
| `floww manage providers` | Interactively manage provider configs |

`floww pull` and all `floww list` commands support `--json` for machine-readable output:

```bash
floww pull <workflow> --json
floww list providers --json
floww list workflows --json
floww list namespaces --json
floww list deployments --json
floww list deployments --workflow <id> --json
```

This outputs raw API data as JSON — full IDs (not truncated), ISO dates (not formatted), all fields (not just table columns).

## Dynamic Provider Documentation

When users ask for detailed information about specific providers (triggers, actions, method signatures, types), use the WebFetch tool to fetch the latest provider implementation from GitHub:

**URL Pattern:**
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/usefloww/floww/main/packages/sdk/providers/<provider-name>/index.ts
```

**Available Providers:**
- `builtin` - Cron, webhook, manual triggers
- `github` - GitHub integration
- `slack` - Slack integration
- `discord` - Discord integration
- `gitlab` - GitLab integration
- `jira` - Jira integration
- `todoist` - Todoist integration
- `kvstore` - Key-value storage
- `secret` - Secret management
- `ai` - AI models (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google)
- `google_calendar` - Google Calendar integration

**What to Extract from TypeScript Files:**

1. **Triggers** - Found in the `triggers = { ... }` object:
   - Method names (e.g., `onPush`, `onMessage`)
   - Parameter types and required fields
   - Handler signature: `(ctx, event) => { ... }`
   - Event body structure

2. **Actions** - Found in the `<Provider>Actions` class:
   - All public methods (e.g., `sendMessage`, `createIssue`)
   - Method parameters and types
   - Return types
   - JSDoc comments if present

3. **Types** - Found in exports:
   - Exported interfaces and types
   - Event payloads
   - Configuration options

**Example Usage:**
When user asks: "How do I use GitHub triggers?" → Fetch from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/usefloww/floww/main/packages/sdk/providers/github/index.ts` and extract the triggers object.
